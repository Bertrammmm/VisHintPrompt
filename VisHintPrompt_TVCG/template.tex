%    Overview of \toolName{}, a visual hint prompt engineering framework for data inference from charts.
%   The method operates in three stages:
%   (1) \emph{axis-aware grid enhancement}, which exposes fine-grained axis priors by overlaying grids aligned with the chart’s underlying structure;
%   (2) \emph{visual feedback prompting}, which introduces model-informed alignment cues to refine intermediate predictions; and
%   (3) \emph{progressive zoom-in refinement}, which enlarges the relevant region to provide high-resolution visual detail for fine-grained and reliable value inference across both Cartesian and radial charts.

%  needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
