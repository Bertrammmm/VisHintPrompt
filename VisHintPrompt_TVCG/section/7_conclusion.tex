\section{Conclusion}
We introduce \toolName{}, a novel visual hint prompting strategy designed to unleash the potential of MLLMs in chart data extraction tasks across diverse chart geometries and coordinate systems, including both Cartesian and polar representations.
Unlike traditional approaches that depend on task-specific training or fine-tuning, 
\toolName{} integrates chain-of-thought prompting with visual-hint-based multimodal strategies, enabling the model to perform numerical inference directly over grid-enhanced chart images. The strategy iteratively refines predictions through a visual feedback mechanism and leverages progressive zoom-in refinement to capture fine-grained visual details, thereby enhancing the model’s perception and interpretation of target data objects. Experimental results demonstrate that \toolName{} constantly improves both interpretability and accuracy of numerical extraction in challenging scenarios, such as small-scale graphical elements.
